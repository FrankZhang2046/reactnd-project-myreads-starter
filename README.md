# MyReads Project Introduction

This is the first project of Udacity's React Nano Degree curriculum. In this project, the objective is to create a basic reading list manager that allows the user to search for books via the provided API backend, add books to one of the three shelves ('to read', 'read', and 'currently reading',) and also be able to freely switch the status of a book among the said shelves.

### Dependencies added (aside from what is provided by the `create-react-app` CLI:)
    - propTypes (prop type safe guarding) 
    - node-sass (working with scss files)


## Installation

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
